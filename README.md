# 90s Weather Channel

View deployed production website at: https://the-90s-weather-channel.netlify.app/

Welcome to 90s Weather Channel web application.
A weather app modeled after 'The Weather Channel' from the 90s/2000s.
Consists of a front-end built with React.js. 
Making calls to a Weather API.

Allowed me to put my CSS skills to use relatively early on in my web dev education.
The main purpose was to have a new application that's personal to me, where I could try new things as I learn them.

Enjoy the nostaligia!
